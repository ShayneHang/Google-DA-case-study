# Coursera - Google Data Analytics Capstone Case Study with R

This is my capstone project for [Google Data Analytics course](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) on coursera. It is an eight-course certification program offered by Google through Coursera's learning platform. Each course dives deep into concepts like working with stakeholders, data integrity, preparing data, cleaning data, visualizing data, and using advanced programs like SQL and R.

The case study i chose to work on will be Case Study 2: How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?

I chose to use RStudio to clean, process and do visualisation for this project because there are some datasets with >1,048,576 rows, which exceed the maximum number of rows excel can load and RStudio is a strong visualisation tool with easy to use syntax.
